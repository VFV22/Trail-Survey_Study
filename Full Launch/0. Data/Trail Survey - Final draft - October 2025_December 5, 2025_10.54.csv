Project title: Trail Management in Hawaiʻi

 

Aloha! You are being asked to take part in a research study that will determine your preferences for outdoor recreation as part of an investigation conducted by the University of Hawaiʻi - Mānoa. You are eligible for this study if you are resident in Hawaiʻi, or have been a visitor to Hawaiʻi, and you are at least 18 years old.

 

Objectives: The goal of this research is to understand how people make choices about hiking trails in Hawai‘i. We are interested in how different trail features, such as habitat quality, trail condition, crowding, and cost, affect these choices. The information collected will be used to better understand trail use and management preferences.

 

Project Description – Activities and Time Commitment: If you decide to take part in this project, you will be asked to fill out a survey. The survey questions are mainly multiple choice. However, there will be a few questions where you may add an open-ended response. Completing the survey will take between 10 and 12 minutes. We expect around 800 people will take part in this project.

 

Benefits and Risks: There will be no direct benefit to you for taking part in this project. We hope that the results of this study will lead to a better understanding of the economic impact of environmental changes and we are hopeful that the results will be used to inform future environmental policy in Hawaiʻi. There is little risk to you for participating in this project. 

 

Confidentiality and Privacy: The study collects no personal identifying information - you will remain anonymous. The records from this study are kept private and only UH researchers will have access to them. Please do not include any personal information in your survey responses. 

 

Voluntary Participation: You can freely choose to take part or to not take part in this survey. There will be no penalty or loss of benefits for either decision. If you do agree to participate, you can stop at any time. 

 

Questions: If you have any questions about this study, please call or email me Kirsten Oleson at 808-956-8864 or koleson@hawaii.edu. You may contact the UH Human Studies Program at  808-956-5007 or uhirb@hawaii.edu to discuss problems, concerns and  questions; obtain information; or offer input with an informed individual who is unaffiliated with the specific research protocol. Please visit https://www,hawaii.edu/researchcompliance/ information-research-participants for more information on your rights as a research participant. Please print a copy of this page for your reference.
