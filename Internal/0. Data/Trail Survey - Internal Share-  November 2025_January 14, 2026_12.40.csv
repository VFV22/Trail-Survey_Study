Project title: Trail Management in Hawaiʻi

 

Aloha! You are being asked to take part in a research study that will determine your preferences for outdoor recreation as part of an investigation conducted by the University of Hawaiʻi - Mānoa. You are eligible for this study if you are resident in Hawaiʻi, or have been a visitor to Hawaiʻi, and you are at least 18 years old.

 

Objectives: The goal of this research is to understand how people make choices about hiking trails in Hawai‘i. We are interested in how different trail features, such as habitat quality, trail condition, crowding, and cost, affect these choices. The information collected will be used to better understand trail use and management preferences.

 

Project Description – Activities and Time Commitment: If you decide to take part in this project, you will be asked to fill out a survey. The survey questions are mainly multiple choice. However, there will be a few questions where you may add an open-ended response. Completing the survey will take between 10 and 12 minutes. We expect around 800 people will take part in this project.

 

Benefits and Risks: There will be no direct benefit to you for taking part in this project. We hope that the results of this study will lead to a better understanding of the economic impact of environmental changes and we are hopeful that the results will be used to inform future environmental policy in Hawaiʻi. There is little risk to you for participating in this project. 

 

Confidentiality and Privacy: The study collects no personal identifying information - you will remain anonymous. The records from this study are kept private and only UH researchers will have access to them. Please do not include any personal information in your survey responses. 

 

Voluntary Participation: You can freely choose to take part or to not take part in this survey. There will be no penalty or loss of benefits for either decision. If you do agree to participate, you can stop at any time. 

 

Questions: If you have any questions about this study, please call or email me Kirsten Oleson at 808-956-8864 or koleson@hawaii.edu. You may contact the UH Human Studies Program at  808-956-5007 or uhirb@hawaii.edu to discuss problems, concerns and  questions; obtain information; or offer input with an informed individual who is unaffiliated with the specific research protocol. Please visit https://www,hawaii.edu/researchcompliance/ information-research-participants for more information on your rights as a research participant. Please print a copy of this page for your reference.

For most people, trails in Hawaii does not simply mean Na Ala Hele trails and County trails, it means paths in the forest wherever they may be. User fees should be used to reopen trails that unfortunately have seen such little use that they have become impassable and therefore see zero use now. Easements should be established for CCC trails, and historic trails. There are many trails that should exist but the state either does not have interest or capacity t open them. For example the historic “Kilohana” trail, running down from the Alakai into Wainiha, was last done in the 1830’s but is very well established as a Hawaiian trail. DOFAW needs to understand that letting the trails be “natural” simply leads to further erosion in most cases, and that they should take over management for existing trails like Moanalua Middle that they simply wash their hands of currently. Boardwalks should be established for many areas to make trails safer and keep people on the trail. Overcrowding is due to having too few trails for people to enjoy. There’s dozens of old trails on Oahu that are essentially impassable, inaccessible, or unenjoyable due to their condition: Waialae nui, Kawailoa, Peahinaia, Opaeula, Castle, Waikane, Waiahole Uka, Malaekahana, Kahuku, DuPont, Pohakea, etc. And Oahu has a lot of trails compared to the rest of the state but they’re mostly concentrated in the Koolaus, the Waianae’s have so few trails which is especially sad for an underserved community. Think about how few trails there are on Maui, or how inaccessible Waimanu and Honokane are currently. Anyway, I could go on but there’s a lot of potential for trails in this state. The peak of trails was 1930 but we can get back to that level with dedicated effort and funding. Getting people on the trail will have added benefits of getting folks interested in native plants and supporting conservation efforts ",,"96701, 96704, 96706, 96707, 96708, 96712, 96713, 96717, 96720, 96722, 96725, 96727, 96730, 96731, 96732, 96734, 96738, 96740, 96741, 96743, 96744, 96746, 96748, 96749, 96750, 96753, 96754, 96756, 96760, 96761, 96762, 96766, 96768, 96771, 96778, 96779, 96781, 96782, 96783, 96786, 96789, 96790, 96791, 96792, 96793, 96795, 96797, 96813, 96814, 96815, 96816, 96817, 96818, 96819, 96821, 96822, 96825, 96826",1,2025-12-06T19:23:41.764Z,1,Tourism,Residents,,2025-12-06T19:35:39.259Z,1322

Trail clearing second most important need. Maintenance of trails third. Limited parking semi-controls numbers. Less trail clearing at the start also helps control use. Trails also need a rest occasionally, so rotating closures might be considered. Closures based upon fire risk are becoming more important as global warming impacts accrue. In the 1970s, DLNR's trail map for Oahu had 88 trails on it. Not so much these days. Perhaps trail access acquisitions might also dilute usage.

While living there and while visiting I have volunteered with the state / county agencies for trail maintenance and also weeding and planting native plants. I do feel that it is very important. You already get a lot of government funding for these projects and have the free use of volunteers' time and efforts. I feel that Hawaii already nickels and dimes their visitors at every chance they can to bleed them dry of their money. Asking visitors to also pay a trail fee is just squeezing your visitors more. You may not know this in Hawaii, but many of your long time loyal visitors have had about enough of being nickeled and dimed by Hawaii and plan to no longer return. I suggest you do not ask your visitors for more money, but ask for more money from your local government, or use your current money more wisely. Just my thoughts.
