#Diagnostic checks on the original Ngene export showed meaningful imbalance in how attribute levels were distributed across the four respondent blocks (sum of squared deviations = 19.93). 
#In particular, the habitat attribute was unevenly allocated (total absolute deviation = 8, mean absolute deviation = 0.67, maximum absolute deviation = 1.75), 
#and crowding also showed elevated imbalance (total_abs_dev = 6.5, mean_abs_dev = 0.54, max_abs_dev = 1.25). 
#These deviations indicate that some attribute levels were substantially over- or under-represented in specific blocks. 


#Statistical consequences of imbalance

#Higher SEs (less precise estimates) for levels that appear infrequently in the blocks actually seen by respondents.
#Potential bias in subgroup comparisons. If residents are assigned mostly block 1 and block 1 has more of Habitat level 3, 
#a higher estimated preference for Habitat in residents might be a design artefact.
#Poor power to detect differences in WTP across groups for attributes with unbalanced representation.

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot(corr_mat_original, method = "color", type = "upper", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)


#Based on the correlation matrix, the Light-to-moderate off-diagonal shading indicates non-zero associations 
#between block and some attributes (notably habitat and cost), 
#motivating targeted rebalancing to avoid block-driven confounding in subgroup analyses.




#For this reason, we apply manual tweaks (small targeted swaps) to lower the imbalance score 
#as well as the overall balance across all attributes.

#Small targeted swaps preserve the D-efficient structure of the Ngene design while removing design-induced confounding;
#this approach improves precision and validity for subgroup comparisons without materially changing the set of plausible 
#choice tasks respondents see.
